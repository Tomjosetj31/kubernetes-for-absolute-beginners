# Kubernetes for absolute beginners

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes provides a number of benefits for containerized applications, including:

- **Scalability**: Kubernetes can automatically scale your application based on resource usage.
- **High availability**: Kubernetes can automatically restart containers that fail, and can distribute traffic across healthy containers.
- **Resource management**: Kubernetes can manage the resources used by your application, including CPU and memory.
- **Rolling updates**: Kubernetes can perform rolling updates of your application, allowing you to update your application without downtime.
- **Service discovery**: Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery and load balancing for your application.

## How does Kubernetes work?

Kubernetes works by defining a desired state for your application using YAML files called manifests. These manifests describe the containers, services, and other resources that make up your application. Kubernetes then uses these manifests to create and manage the resources needed to run your application.

## Getting started with Kubernetes

To get started with Kubernetes, you'll need to install the `kubectl` command-line tool and a Kubernetes cluster. You can use a managed Kubernetes service like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), or you can set up your own cluster using tools like Minikube or kubeadm.

Once you have a cluster set up, you can start deploying your applications using Kubernetes manifests. You can use the `kubectl apply` command to apply your manifests to the cluster, and `kubectl get` to view the resources that Kubernetes has created.

## Kubernetes concepts

Kubernetes has a number of key concepts that you'll need to understand in order to work with it effectively. Some of the most important concepts include:

- **Pods**: Pods are the smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes. A pod is a group of one or more containers that are deployed together on the same host.

- **Deployments**: Deployments are used to manage the lifecycle of pods. A deployment defines the desired state for a set of pods, and Kubernetes will automatically create, scale, and update the pods to match this desired state.

- **Services**: Services are used to expose pods to the outside world. A service provides a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods, and can load balance traffic across the pods.

- **Namespaces**: Namespaces are used to organize resources in Kubernetes. By default, all resources are created in the `default` namespace, but you can create additional namespaces to separate resources.

- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: ConfigMaps and Secrets are used to store configuration data and sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys. ConfigMaps are used for non-sensitive data, while Secrets are used for sensitive data.

- **Volumes**: Volumes are used to provide persistent storage for pods. Kubernetes supports a number of different types of volumes, including emptyDir, hostPath, and persistentVolumeClaim.

- **Labels and Selectors**: Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to resources in Kubernetes. Selectors are used to select resources based on their labels, allowing you to group and filter resources.

- **Annotations**: Annotations are key-value pairs that are attached to resources in Kubernetes. Annotations are used to provide additional information about resources, such as build information or monitoring data.

- **Ingress**: Ingress is used to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Ingress controllers are used to route traffic to the appropriate services based on the requested URL.

- **Helm**: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and upgrade applications on your cluster. Helm uses charts to define the resources needed to run an application, and can be used to manage dependencies between applications.

- **Operators**: Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. Operators are built using the Operator Framework, and can be used to automate complex tasks, such as database backups or scaling.

- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: CRDs are used to extend the Kubernetes API with custom resources. CRDs allow you to define new resource types, such as databases or message queues, and manage them using Kubernetes.

- **StatefulSets**: StatefulSets are used to manage stateful applications in Kubernetes. StatefulSets provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of pod names, and can be used to manage databases, caches, and other stateful applications.

- **DaemonSets**: DaemonSets are used to run a copy of a pod on every node in the cluster. DaemonSets are used for tasks that need to run on every node, such as log collection or monitoring.

- **Jobs and CronJobs**: Jobs are used to run a pod to completion, and are used for batch processing tasks. CronJobs are used to run a job on a schedule, and are used for tasks like backups or data processing.

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: HPA is used to automatically scale the number of pods in a deployment based on resource usage. HPA can scale pods based on CPU or memory usage, or custom metrics provided by a metrics server.

- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Cluster Autoscaler is used to automatically scale the number of nodes in a cluster based on resource usage. Cluster Autoscaler can add or remove nodes from the cluster to ensure that there are enough resources available for the pods running on the cluster.

- **Pod Security Policies**: Pod Security Policies are used to control the security settings for pods in a cluster. Pod Security Policies can be used to restrict the use of privileged containers, host networking, and other security-sensitive features.

- **Network Policies**: Network Policies are used to control the network traffic between pods in a cluster. Network Policies can be used to restrict the flow of traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and other criteria.

- **Pod Disruption Budgets**: Pod Disruption Budgets are used to control the disruption of pods in a cluster. Pod Disruption Budgets can be used to ensure that a certain number of pods are available at all times, and can be used to prevent all pods from being deleted at once.

- **Resource Quotas**: Resource Quotas are used to limit the amount of resources that can be used by pods in a namespace. Resource Quotas can be used to prevent a single application from using all of the resources in a cluster, and can be used to enforce resource limits for different teams or applications.

<!-- - **Pod Priority and Preemption**: Pod Priority and Preemption are used to control the scheduling of pods in a cluster. Pod Priority can be used to prioritize certain pods over others, and Preemption can be used to evict lower-priority pods to make room for higher-priority pods.

- **Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity**: Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity are used to control the placement of pods in a cluster. Pod Affinity can be used to ensure that pods are scheduled on the same node or in the same zone, while Anti-Affinity can be used to ensure that pods are scheduled on different nodes or in different zones.

- **Pod Overhead**: Pod Overhead is used to account for the additional resources used by a pod, such as the container runtime, logging, and monitoring. Pod Overhead can be used to ensure that there are enough resources available for the pod to run successfully.

- **Pod Security Context**: Pod Security Context is used to control the security settings for containers in a pod. Pod Security Context can be used to restrict the use of privileged containers, host networking, and other security-sensitive features.

- **Container Security Policies**: Container Security Policies are used to control the security settings for containers in a pod. Container Security Policies can be used to restrict the use of privileged containers, host networking, and other security-sensitive features.

- **Pod Lifecycle**: Pods have a number of different states in their lifecycle, including Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, and Unknown. Pods can transition between these states based on events like container startup, container failure, and pod deletion.

- **Pod Readiness and Liveness Probes**: Pod Readiness and Liveness Probes are used to monitor the health of containers in a pod. Readiness Probes are used to determine when a pod is ready to accept traffic, while Liveness Probes are used to determine when a container needs to be restarted.

- **Pod Resource Requests and Limits**: Pod Resource Requests and Limits are used to specify the amount of CPU and memory that a pod requires. Resource Requests are used to reserve resources for a pod, while Limits are used to restrict the amount of resources that a pod can use.

- **Pod Environment Variables**: Pod Environment Variables are used to pass configuration data to containers in a pod. Environment Variables can be used to provide information like database connection strings, API keys, and other configuration data.

- **Pod Volumes**: Pod Volumes are used to provide persistent storage for containers in a pod. Volumes can be used to store data that needs to persist across container restarts, such as databases, logs, and configuration files.

- **Pod Init Containers**: Pod Init Containers are used to run one or more containers before the main containers in a pod start. Init Containers can be used to perform tasks like database migrations, configuration updates, and data loading.

- **Pod Sidecar Containers**: Pod Sidecar Containers are used to run one or more containers alongside the main containers in a pod. Sidecar Containers can be used to perform tasks like logging, monitoring, and security scanning.

- **Pod Multi-Container Patterns**: Pod Multi-Container Patterns are used to define common patterns for running multiple containers in a pod. Multi-Container Patterns can be used to define sidecar containers, adapter containers, and ambassador containers.

- **Pod Design Patterns**: Pod Design Patterns are used to define common patterns for designing pods in Kubernetes. Design Patterns can be used to define stateless pods, stateful pods, batch processing pods, and other types of pods.

- **Pod Anti-Patterns**: Pod Anti-Patterns are used to define common mistakes to avoid when designing pods in Kubernetes. Anti-Patterns can be used to avoid issues like resource contention, network bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities.

- **Pod Best Practices**: Pod Best Practices are used to define common practices for designing pods in Kubernetes. Best Practices can be used to ensure that pods are secure, scalable, and reliable, and can be used to avoid common pitfalls.

- **Pod Troubleshooting**: Pod Troubleshooting is used to diagnose and fix issues with pods in Kubernetes. Troubleshooting can be used to identify issues like container crashes, resource contention, and network problems, and can be used to resolve these issues quickly.

- **Pod Monitoring and Logging**: Pod Monitoring and Logging is used to monitor the health and performance of pods in Kubernetes. Monitoring and Logging can be used to track metrics like CPU and memory usage, request latency, and error rates, and can be used to troubleshoot issues with pods.

- **Pod Security Best Practices**: Pod Security Best Practices are used to define common practices for securing pods in Kubernetes. Security Best Practices can be used to ensure that pods are protected from attacks, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations, and can be used to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data.

- **Pod Networking**: Pod Networking is used to define how pods communicate with each other and with external services. Pod Networking can be used to configure network policies, service discovery, load balancing, and other networking features in Kubernetes.

- **Pod Storage**: Pod Storage is used to define how pods store and access data. Pod Storage can be used to configure volumes, persistent storage, and other storage features in Kubernetes.

- **Pod Scheduling**: Pod Scheduling is used to define how pods are scheduled onto nodes in a cluster. Pod Scheduling can be used to configure node selectors, affinity and anti-affinity rules, taints and tolerations, and other scheduling features in Kubernetes.
